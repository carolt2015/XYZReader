# XYZReader 
 
XYZReader has been redesigned to meet the Android Material Design guidelines. This project is a part of Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree coursework. With app reviews retrieved from users complaining about the quality of the app, lack of a consistent color theme, unreadable text and smooth transitioning between pages, the app has been redesigned by applying concepts of Material Design.
